# Projects

# [Estimation-of-Healthcare-cost-and-Healthcare-Quality-in-OECD-Countries](https://github.com/ARGULASAISURAJ/Estimation-of-Healthcare-cost-and-Healthcare-Quality-in-OECD-Countries)

Summary-
* Statistical modelling helps us to determine where our research needs to be focused and realize the factors that impact the healthcare quality and expenses. 
* The main objective of our research and analysis is to understand how to minimize the health expenses while improving or maintaining the same health quality. 
* Collection of data and data source play a paramount role in the analysis. we have built our own dataset by taking the data from reliable resources such as OECD and WHO after analyzing the literature. 
* Two independent models have been built to understand and analyze the factors that are affecting healthcare quality and expenses. The statistical data modelling involved building up of several models and to find out the unbiased model that generalizes and provide feasible recommendations that could reduce the health expenses and improve the health quality. 
* The key insights from our models is that the life expectancy of a country can be improved by increasing the health resources such as hospitals, medical graduates. The countryâ€™s healthcare expenses can have the maximum benefit when we bring more % of population under public insurance. 

# [Predicting Concrete Strength using Regression with Keras](https://github.com/ARGULASAISURAJ/Predicting-Concrete-Strength-using-Regression-with-Keras)

* In this notebook,I have used Keras library to build a regression model that predicts the concrete strength given its ingredients values like Cement, BlastFurnace, Flyash,Water Superplasticizer, Coarse aggregate, Fine aggregate and age. I have used regression model because strength is a continuous data in the dataset.

# [Neighborhood-segmentation-and-Clustering-in-the-City-of-Tampa](https://github.com/ARGULASAISURAJ/Neighborhood-segmentation-and-Clustering-in-the-City-of-Tampa)

* In this project,I have segmented neighbourhoods in the city of tampa, and clustered them  with unsupervised learning, to suggest new neighbourhood to set up business. In this particular project, i have used movie theatre as a business. 


# [Classify-Drug-respopnse-on-patients](https://github.com/ARGULASAISURAJ/Classify-Drug-respopnse-on-patients)

* In this project, i used decison tree classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications and used that model to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

# [Human-Cancer-Cell-Classification-using-SVM](https://github.com/ARGULASAISURAJ/Human-Cancer-Cell-Classification-using-SVM)

* In this Project, SVM (Support Vector Machines) is used to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
